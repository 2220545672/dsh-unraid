/**
 * Cross-repository check: does the template still describe the image it installs?
 *
 * The template and the image now live in two repositories
 * (2220545672/dsh-unraid and 2220545672/dsh-docker). The contract between them is
 * small but silently breakable: every `<Config Type="Variable" Target="NAME">` in
 * the template is an environment variable that the image's entrypoint has to
 * understand. Rename one on the image side and the template keeps handing the
 * container a variable nobody reads — the container starts, looks fine, and the
 * operator's setting does nothing. Nothing else in either repository would notice.
 *
 * So this fetches the image repository's entrypoint (main branch) and asserts that
 * every variable the template sets is mentioned there. The reverse direction is not
 * a failure: an image variable that no template field exposes is a legitimate
 * choice (as long as the default is sensible), and it is reported as a note.
 *
 * A network failure is a warning, not an error: this offline-friendly repository
 * must stay checkable on a host that cannot reach raw.githubusercontent.com (China
 * blocks it for some networks — the icon URL in ca_profile.xml goes through a proxy
 * for that reason). CI runs on GitHub's runners, where the fetch works, so the
 * check is real where it matters.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-image-contract.mjs [templates/dsh.xml]
